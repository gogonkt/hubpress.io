<mvll> I thinking about how to make a package manager  in forth
11:10 AM M<mvll> and I search it, got your and Gareld got same idea 
11:11 AM M<mvll> LOL
11:11 AM P<@pointfree> Yes
11:13 AM P<@pointfree> I think it may be advantageous to have fine grained, content addressable package management for individual words. Gerald Wodni did it with libraries.
11:13 AM M<mvll> I think that a tool help developer speed up forth application is great
11:14 AM M<mvll> something like brew, nmp,,,,
11:17 AM P<@pointfree> Agreed. I think it would be important for such a package management tool to support diverging factorings and refactorings... because forths benefit a lot from reshaping and deleting words to fit the application at hand... code is the user interface.
11:18 AM M<mvll> manager by word or libaries ....., sound intersting
11:20 AM P<@pointfree> On the other hand converging word definitions could be an alternative to standardization without a tendency for stagnation.
11:22 AM M<mvll> What can help forth back to real world,  package manager maybe a one thing , modem developing tools a had a PM, for example, PM help linux easy use very much
11:30 AM M<mvll> we can install whole package > fpm install foo > or install a word "bar" in foo > fpm install foo bar
11:31 AM M<mvll> fpm install bar @ foo >is better
11:33 AM P<@pointfree> Indeed.
11:33 AM P<@pointfree> IMO, something else that currently prevents forth from becoming ecosystem oriented with package management etc, is the lack of support for unplanned, ad-hoc computing.
11:33 AM P<@pointfree> Forth words are abbreviations, I think that's good, but if filtering interactions were easier, while retaining the structure of concise abbreviations, I think forth would benefit from an ecosystem as well.

<@pointfree> mvll: @ words from the package repositories. I like it.
11:33 AM M<mvll> maybe do it in a forth way 
11:34 AM P<@pointfree> The tick ' could also double as the package manager word.
11:34 AM M<mvll> ahha
11:35 AM P<@pointfree> Getting words from the network when they are not available locally.
11:35 AM M<mvll> we can put package on github like homebrew do
11:36 AM M— mvll off for luch time
11:36 AM P<@pointfree> enjoy your lunch!
11:37 AM M<mvll> Thx!
11:41 AM M<mvll> LOL, got a idea! we can make Matrix Dictionany, and then >> : newbar fpm@ bar ; >>, but how it work and no idea yet :P (off again)
11:43 AM P<@pointfree> Interesting!
3:34 PM M— mvll 
3:34 PM M— mvll back
3:44 PM M<mvll> the raw idea is, we mantain a Matrix Dictionary on internet, fpm work like forth interprepter do and : newbar fpm bar @ foo ; immediate  >> will fetch the remote words to local dictionary(do we need a "remote dictionary" handle it?)
3:45 PM M<mvll> and we need "fpm" as a tool to handle search, install, unstall, clean cache, bla bla........
3:49 PM M<mvll> aka. a forh core with "cloud" power
4:10 PM M<mvll> or : newbar bar fpm@ foo ; immediate
4:29 PM M<mvll> ( usage ..... ) for fpm usage bar, ( doc .... ) for fpm info bar
4:30 PM M<mvll> The word address is URL to where can get the word
